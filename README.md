# Python Warmup – 7 Days from Scratch

This repo tracks my first 7 days of learning Python. I'm starting from zero, no prior coding experience, and using short daily challenges to build a real foundation.

## Why I'm Doing This

I want to learn Python to figure out if I'm more into data science or machine learning. Before picking a path, I’m testing the waters by:
- Learning core Python
- Doing daily coding tasks (30–45 mins)
- Writing and explaining my code
- Tracking progress here publicly

## Daily Breakdown

| Day | Focus | File |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Print, Variables, Input | `day01_basics.py` |
| 2 | If, Else, Logic | `day02_if_else.py` |
| 3 | Loops (for, while) | `day03_loops.py` |
| 4 | Functions | `day04_functions.py` |
| 5 | Lists & Dictionaries | `day05_data_structures.py` |
| 6 | Mini Project | `day06_project.py` |
| 7 | Recap + Refactor | `day07_review.py` |

## Notes

All code is written in plain Python, no external libraries yet. Explanations and notes will be added as comments inside each file or in a `notes.md` file.

## Next Steps

After this warmup, I'll do:
- 1 week of hands-on data science
- 1 week of basic machine learning

That should help me choose which path to follow deeper.
